# Assignment - Scheduling Framework
#### tags: `Assignment`, `Scheduling`

## Requirement

- **Environment:** kind 1.17.17
- **Language:** go1.17.6


## Problem Description

Currently, default kubernetes scheduler can only do FIFO(First-In-First-Out) scheduling.  
In this assignment, we are going to implement a custom scheduler by [Scheduling framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/).  
It schedules jobs(pods) according to the following rules:  
1. Workloads will be assigned the label(`groupName`) by user, which is used to distinguish the different groups.
2. User will also assigned the label(`groupPriority`) to determine the scheduling priority of different groups.
3. The priority of every workload in same group depends on [QoS level](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/) (`Guaranteed`>`Burstable`>`BestEffort`) by user.
4. Each group will start to schedule only when the number of pods in the group >= the minimum available number(`minAvailable`)

### Label Description
Yaml file will provide the following labels, which can be used for judgement.  
Please note that when testing,   
we will assume that pods with the same podGroup settings will have same `miniAvailable` and `groupPriority`   

+ `groupName`: the group name of the workload.
    + If the workload has same name, they will be viewed as same group. Otherwise, they are different groups.
+ `groupPriority`: the priority of the group.
    + The higher groupPriority value, the higher scheduling priority.
+ `minAvailable`: the minimum available number of group.

## Hint  

+ There are three parts you need to do:
    1. Trace the code
    2. Tag “TODO” is the place you need to modify or implement
    3. Deploy your own program & Test
+ Implement plugin：
    + **QueueSort**
        +  Compare the priority of pods first.
        +  If the priority of pods are equal, then comapre the QOS 
    + **PreFilter**
        + If the number of pods in same group < minAvailable,  then the pod will reject and retry later.
+ **Writing logs** is a good habit.

## Check

+ Check your program is working.
```bash=
$ kubectl get pod -n kube-system
```

+ Input Example1
    + Description:
    ```
        There is a job, `nginx` and its group is also called the same name.
        According the file of yaml, we can see there is a constraint that this service must has 3 pods, 
        then the pods will start to be scheduled to the nodes.
        
        Actually, the operator made a mistake, he accidentally typed the wrong number.

        Thus, we can see ...

        The number of Pods in same group < minAvailable, so the pod status is `Pending`.

        When we check the log, we can find the situation that the number of pods in same group is less than minAvailable.

        There are three jobs, red, green, yellow and the qos level is the same.
        Each job is a group consisting of 10 pods.
        Each job must have at least two pods to start scheduling.
        The order of scheduling pods is sorted by priority,
        and the priority is Red>Yellow>Green(1000>500>100).

        The example you can test the pods in same group have the same priority, but have different qos level.
        The qos level of black-pusheen: **BestEffort**.
        The qos level of gray-pusheen: **Burstable**.
        The qos level of white-pusheen: **Guaranteed**.

        We can expected that the white-pusheen has the highest scheduling prioity 
        and the black-pushenn has the lowest scheduling prioity in this case.
